- Homework3 (HW3) is to write a function to automate the k-means clustering algorithm. 
- HW4 is to practice k-nearest neighbor algorithm, k-fold cross validation, and calculate the misclassification errors
- HW5 is to use linear regression model for prediction, 
and conduct Monte Carlo Simulation Study to evaluate the numerical performence of the algorithm, as well as to validate some theoretical properties.
- HW6 to utilize variable selection techniques, both stepwise and LASSO, 
to find one or more parsimonious linear models to predict and explain the Ames housing price.
- HW7 is to employ logistic regression to explain and predict bankruptcy with predictors and examine the models using AUC, ROC, Misclassification Rate, True Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, etc.
- HW8 is to produce a Managerial Report: Predictive Modeling for Banking Term Deposits. Four models were assessed under two cost frameworks (symmetric cost vs asymmetric cost) via performance metrics (accuracy, precision, and AUC).
